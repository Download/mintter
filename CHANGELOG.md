## 🚨 Known Issues

- Draft auto-saving is unreliable and sometimes results in lost content or unexpected results when committing
  - Please refresh the draft page with `Cmd-R` on a regular basis and before you commit
  - For important content, we reccommend you write the draft outside the app and copy it in
- Documents do not open via URL in the quick switcher, when the app has been freshly loaded
  - You can open the document by connecting to peers and waiting for the sync to complete.
- Code blocks do not support `tab` key correctly
  - You can paste code with indentation and it will appear correctly
