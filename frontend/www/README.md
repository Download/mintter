## Technologies

- NextJS - gives you a really nice and easy platform for building React apps, with many handy things like hot reload out of the box.
- TypeScript - types are great! I'm too old for debugging type issues.
- SlateJS - framework for buildling rich text editors. It's new and looks like pretty simple and flexible.
- TailwindCSS - utility-first CSS toolkit. It's great! Built with design-systems in mind, allows for building custom designs seamlessly.
